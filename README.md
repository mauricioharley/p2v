# P2V
A repository to share PowerShell code that I wrote to execute a massive P2V migration.

# Scope
Customer had more than 200 Windows Server 2003 servers and the need was to migrate all of this to Windows Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V virtual machines. Besides this, new domain controllers should be provisioned, files should be copied, new printer queues created and many other tasks.  Check individual files to know more.

# Purpose
To manually run the physical to virtual migration would overcome project's time. Besides leading the team and splitting tasks among team members, I assume the responsibility to automate as much as possible and this was feasible through PowerShell.
